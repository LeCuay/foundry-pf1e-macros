## AwardXP
Award XP macro builds a checklist of PCs and allows the GM to distribute a given amount of XP to the PCs (either all receiving the same or an equal share of the amount).

If there is currently a combat active, builds a checklist of NPCs to automatically add to the XP calculation.

## summonMonster
Allows any user with permission to create actors and tokens (default for GMs, configurable for players) to import a monster from a compendium and create a given number of tokens for that monster on the map.

Customizable for what package(s) to pull actors from and where to file them in the game world.

Follows Pathfinder 1e rules for Summon Monster and Summon Nature's Ally for duration and range (mostly just for chat output of the summon details). Extend and Range metamagic options available.

If Turn Alert module is active and there is currently a combat, will create an alert for when the summons expire.
